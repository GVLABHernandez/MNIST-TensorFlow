### Overview

This repository will be used during the Deep learning Python programming class to create:

- A fully connected Neural Network (DNN.py)
- A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN.py) 
- A Recurrent Neural Network with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells (RNN.py)

The goal of these classes is to classify this:
